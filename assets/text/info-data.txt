Song Lyrics

-TANGA by KAIA
"Ohh hey
Matagal ko nang napapansin minsan ay nagpipigil
Kasi nga ayokong na masasaktan kita
Maraming nagsasabi na isa kang malaking problema
Pero 'di naman ako naalis kahit na
Sabi nga ni mama 'wag kang magtitiwala
Sa mga lalaking gaya mong masyadong magaling sa drama
Lupit sa pabango tunay na baho mo
Sa loob 'di mo matago alam kong 'di makuntento
Huwag kang magagalit kung ayoko nang kumapit
Sinusubukan ko lahat ng makakaya ko
Huwag sanang magalit kung nalulungkot palagi
Ayaw ka ng lahat pero andito pa rin ako
Na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-na-na
'Di naman ako nagtitiwala na (nagtitiwala na)
Kasi nga laro mo'y kabisado na (kabisado na)
Sino bang niloko ko alam kong hindi 'to totoo
Ngayon lang galit-galitan 'to pero inlove pa rin naman sa'yo
Sabi nga ni mama 'wag kang tanga-tanga (tanga)
Huwag magpapaloko sa gaya mong magaling sa salita (magaling sa salita)
Pero nakuha mo marupok na puso ko
'Di makapaniwala nahulog sa isang tulad mo
Huwag kang magagalit kung ayoko nang kumapit
Sinusubukan ko lahat ng makakaya ko (okay)
Huwag sanang magalit kung nalulungkot palagi
Ayaw ka ng lahat pero andito pa rin ako
Na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-na-na
Nandito pa rin ako
Nandito pa rin ako"
